			My name is Natalia Pacheco-Tallaj, I am an undergraduate studying mathematics at Harvard University. I am interested in all areas of math, but lately I've been focused in knot theory, algebraic topology, and differential topology. This summer I will be at Williams' SMALL program, doing knot theory. On a more computational note: In the past, I've worked on assistive technologies research, cryptography research, and web-development. Here's my CV.<br />

			I also make art. I was mostly self-taught, until I took a drawing class at Harvard last semester. When I am not scribbling about manifolds or drawing, I enjoy taking long walks, watching sci-fi, listening to folk music, and spending with friends and family.<br />

			I am very passionate about inclusivity in mathematics and in STEM (gender, race, income,...). I am proud and honored to serve as a board member for Harvard Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics, and to have had the opportunity to organize the 2018 Women in Math and Statistics Conference last Spring.
